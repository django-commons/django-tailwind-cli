# Usage

!!! question "Do I have to install the Tailwind CLI?"

    **No.** The management commands of this library handle the download and installation of the Tailwind CLI. You don't have to deal with this. But you can configure the installation location and the version of the CLI you want to use. Take a look at the [settings](settings.md) section.

!!! question "Do I have to create my own `tailwind.config.js` for Tailwind 3.x?"

    **No.** The management commands also take care of this step. If no `tailwind.config.js` is present in your project, a new one with sane defaults will be created. Afterwards this file will be used and be customized by you. The default location for the file is the `BASE_DIR` of your project, but you can change this. Take a look at the [settings](settings.md) section.

!!! question "Do I have to create my own `css/source.css` for Tailwind 4.x?"

    **No.** The management commands also take care of this step. If no `css/source.css` is present in your project, a new one with sane defaults will be created. Afterwards this file will be used and be customized by you. The default location for the file is first folder from the `STATICFILES_DIRS` of your project, but you can change this. Take a look at the [settings](settings.md) section.

## Management commands

### build

Run `python manage.py tailwind build` to create an optimized production built of the stylesheet. Afterwards you are ready to deploy. Take care the this command is run before `python manage.py collectstatic` in your build process.

### download_cli

Run `python manage.py tailwind download_cli` to just download the CLI. This commands downloads the correct version of the CLI for your platform and stores it in the path configured by the `TAILWIND_CLI_PATH` setting.

### list_templates

Run `python manage.py tailwind list_templates` to find all templates in your django project. This is handy for a setup where you dynamically build the list of files being analyzed by tailwindcss.

### remove_cli

Run `python manage.py tailwind remove_cli` to remove the installed cli.

### runserver

Run `python manage.py tailwind runserver` to start the classic Django debug server in parallel to a tailwind watcher process.

```shell
Usage: manage.py tailwind runserver
           [OPTIONS] [ADDRPORT]

  Run the development server with Tailwind CSS CLI in watch mode.

  If django-extensions is installed along with this library, this command runs
  the runserver_plus command from django-extensions. Otherwise it runs the
  default runserver command.

Arguments:
  [ADDRPORT]  Optional port number, or ipaddr:port

Options:
  -6, --ipv6                      Tells Django to use an IPv6 address.
  --nothreading                   Tells Django to NOT use threading.
  --nostatic                      Tells Django to NOT automatically serve
                                  static files at STATIC_URL.
  --noreload                      Tells Django to NOT use the auto-reloader.
  --skip-checks                   Skip system checks.
  --pdb                           Drop into pdb shell at the start of any
                                  view. (Requires django-extensions.)
  --ipdb                          Drop into ipdb shell at the start of any
                                  view. (Requires django-extensions.)
  --pm                            Drop into (i)pdb shell if an exception is
                                  raised in a view. (Requires django-
                                  extensions.)
  --print-sql                     Print SQL queries as they're executed.
                                  (Requires django-extensions.)
  --print-sql-location            Show location in code where SQL query
                                  generated from. (Requires django-
                                  extensions.)
  --cert-file TEXT                SSL .crt file path. If not provided path
                                  from --key-file will be selected. Either
                                  --cert-file or --key-file must be provided
                                  to use SSL. (Requires django-extensions.)
  --key-file TEXT                 SSL .key file path. If not provided path
                                  from --cert-file will be selected. Either
                                  --cert-file or --key-file must be provided
                                  to use SSL. (Requires django-extensions.)
  --force-default-runserver / --no-force-default-runserver
                                  Force the use of the default runserver
                                  command even if django-extensions is
                                  installed.   [default: no-force-default-
                                  runserver]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

### watch

Run `python manage.py tailwind watch` to just start a tailwind watcher process if you prefer to start your debug server in a seperate shell or prefer a different solution than runserver or runserver_plus.

## Use with Docker Compose

When used in the `watch` mode, the Tailwind CLI requires a TTY-enabled environment to function correctly. In a Docker Compose setup, ensure that the container executing the Tailwind style rebuild command (either `python manage.py tailwind runserver` or `python manage.py tailwind watch`, as noted above) is configured with the `tty: true` setting in your `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
web:
  command: python manage.py tailwind runserver
  tty: true

# or

tailwind-sidecar:
  command: python manage.py tailwind watch
  tty: true
```
