# Settings & Configuration

## Settings

The package can be configured by a few settings, which can be overwritten in the `settings.py` of
your project.

### TAILWIND_CLI_VERSION

**Default**: `"latest"`

This defines the version of the CLI and of Tailwind CSS you want to use in your project.

If it is set to `latest`, the management commands try to determine the most recent version of Tailwind CSS by placing a request to GitHub and parse the location header of the redirect. If this is not possible a fallback version is used. This version is defined in the module `django_tailwind_cli.config`.

If you want to pinpoint your setup to certain version of Tailwind CSS, then you can set `TAILWIND_CLI_VERSION`to a fixed version number.

For example:
```python
TAILWIND_CLI_VERSION = "4.1.0"
```

### TAILWIND_CLI_PATH

**Default**: `.django_tailwind_cli`

This allows you to override the default of the library where to store the CLI binary.

The default behaviour is to store the CLI binary in the hidden directory `.django_tailwind_cli` within the project.

But if you want to store it elsewhere or plan to use a custom build binary stored locally, change this setting either to a path to a directory or the full path to the binary. If it points to a directory, this is the download destination otherwise it directly tries to use the referenced binary.

:::{warning}
If you use the new option from **2.7.0** but haven't installed a binary before running any of the management commands, these commands will treat the configured path as a directory and create it, if it is missing. Afterwards the official CLI will be downloaded to this path.

In case you want to use the new behaviour, it is highly recommended to also set the new setting `TAILWIND_CLI_AUTOMATIC_DOWNLOAD` to `False`.
:::

### TAILWIND_CLI_AUTOMATIC_DOWNLOAD

**Default**: `True`

Enable or disable the automatic downloading of the official CLI to your machine.

### TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_REPO

**Default**: `"tailwindlabs/tailwindcss"`

Specifies the repository from which the CLI is downloaded. This is useful if you are using a customized version of the CLI, such as [tailwind-cli-extra](https://github.com/dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra).

:::{warning}
If you use this option, ensure that you update the `TAILWIND_CLI_VERSION` to match the version of the customized CLI you are using. Additionally, you may need to update the `TAILWIND_CLI_ASSET_NAME` if the asset name is different. See the example below.
:::

### TAILWIND_CLI_ASSET_NAME

**Default**: `"tailwindcss"`

Specifies the name of the asset to download from the repository.

This option is particularly useful if the customized repository you are using has a different name for the Tailwind CLI asset. For example, the asset name for [tailwind-cli-extra](https://github.com/dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra/releases/latest/) is `tailwindcss-extra`.

:::{note}
Here is a full example of using a custom repository and asset name:
```python
TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_REPO = "dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra"
TAILWIND_CLI_ASSET_NAME = "tailwindcss-extra"
```
:::

### TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_CSS

**Default**: `".django_tailwind_cli/source.css"`

This variable can be set to a relative path and an absolute path.

If it is a relative path it is assumed to be relative to `settings.BASE_DIR`. If `settings.BASE_DIR` is not defined or the file doesn't exist a `ValueError` is raised.

If it is an absolute path, this path is used as the input file for Tailwind CSS CLI. If the path doesn't exist, a `ValueError` is raised.

### TAILWIND_CLI_DIST_CSS

**Default**: `"css/tailwind.css"`

The name of the output file. This file is stored relative to the first element of the
`STATICFILES_DIRS` array.

### TAILWIND_CLI_CSS_MAP

**Default**: `None`

A list of tuples defining multiple CSS source/destination pairs. Each tuple contains:
- Source CSS file path (relative to `BASE_DIR`)
- Destination CSS file path (relative to `STATICFILES_DIRS[0]`)

```python
TAILWIND_CLI_CSS_MAP = [
    ("admin.css", "admin.output.css"),
    ("web.css", "web.output.css"),
]
```

:::{warning}
This setting is **mutually exclusive** with `TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_CSS` and `TAILWIND_CLI_DIST_CSS`.
You cannot use both configuration modes at the same time. If `TAILWIND_CLI_CSS_MAP` is defined,
the single-file settings will be ignored and a warning will be raised.
:::

The entry name is derived from the source filename (without extension). This name can be used
with the `{% tailwind_css %}` template tag to include specific CSS files.

### TAILWIND_CLI_USE_DAISY_UI

**Default**: `False`

Enables [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) support using the official standalone approach. When enabled, the library automatically downloads the DaisyUI standalone plugin files (`daisyui.mjs` and `daisyui-theme.mjs`) from the official DaisyUI releases and places them next to your source CSS file. The standard Tailwind CSS CLI is used — no third-party fork needed.

If `TAILWIND_CLI_USE_DAISY_UI = True` is set, the auto-generated source CSS contains:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@source not "./daisyui{,*}.mjs";
@plugin "./daisyui.mjs";
@plugin "./daisyui-theme.mjs";
```

### TAILWIND_CLI_DAISY_UI_VERSION

**Default**: `"latest"`

Controls the version of DaisyUI to download when `TAILWIND_CLI_USE_DAISY_UI = True`. Works like `TAILWIND_CLI_VERSION` — set to `"latest"` to auto-detect the newest release, or pin to a specific version.

For example:
```python
TAILWIND_CLI_DAISY_UI_VERSION = "5.0.3"
```

## Configuration Patterns

### Default

The library works out of the box with sensible defaults. No configuration is required:

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "django_tailwind_cli",
]

STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "assets"]
```

### Custom Source CSS

Using a custom source CSS file for additional Tailwind configuration:

```python
# settings.py
TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_CSS = "src/styles/main.css"
```

Example content of `src/styles/main.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

/* Custom base styles */
@layer base {
  html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }

  body {
    @apply font-sans antialiased;
  }
}

/* Custom components */
@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
}

/* Custom utilities */
@layer utilities {
  .text-shadow {
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
  }
}
```

### DaisyUI

If you plan to use [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com), there is an easy way to solve this with this library.

```python
TAILWIND_CLI_USE_DAISY_UI = True
```

This uses the official DaisyUI standalone approach: two `.mjs` plugin files (`daisyui.mjs` and `daisyui-theme.mjs`) are automatically downloaded from the [DaisyUI releases](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/releases/) and placed next to your source CSS file. The standard Tailwind CSS CLI is used — no third-party fork needed.

To pin a specific DaisyUI version:

```python
TAILWIND_CLI_USE_DAISY_UI = True
TAILWIND_CLI_DAISY_UI_VERSION = "5.0.3"
```

For custom CSS with theme configuration, create your own source CSS file:

```python
TAILWIND_CLI_USE_DAISY_UI = True
TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_CSS = "src/styles/daisyui.css"
```

Example content of `src/styles/daisyui.css` with theme configuration:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@source not "./daisyui{,*}.mjs";

@plugin "./daisyui.mjs";
@plugin "./daisyui-theme.mjs" {
  themes: nord --default, abyss --prefersdark, cupcake, dracula;
}
```

For more configuration options, see the [DaisyUI Configuration Documentation](https://daisyui.com/docs/config/).

:::{note}
If you are migrating from a previous version that used the `tailwind-cli-extra` fork, update your source CSS:
- Replace `@plugin "daisyui";` with `@plugin "./daisyui.mjs";` and `@plugin "./daisyui-theme.mjs";`
- Add `@source not "./daisyui{,*}.mjs";` to exclude the plugin files from scanning
- You can remove any `TAILWIND_CLI_SRC_REPO` or `TAILWIND_CLI_ASSET_NAME` overrides
:::

### Multiple CSS Entry Points

For projects that need separate CSS files for different parts of the application (e.g., admin panel and public website):

```python
# settings.py
TAILWIND_CLI_CSS_MAP = [
    ("styles/admin.css", "css/admin.css"),
    ("styles/web.css", "css/web.css"),
]
```

Example source files:

`styles/admin.css`:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@source "../templates/admin/**/*.html";

@layer components {
  .admin-panel {
    @apply bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg;
  }
}
```

`styles/web.css`:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@source "../templates/web/**/*.html";

@layer components {
  .hero-section {
    @apply bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600;
  }
}
```

In your templates, include all CSS files or filter by name:

```htmldjango
{# Include all CSS files #}
{% tailwind_css %}

{# Include only admin CSS #}
{% tailwind_css "admin" %}

{# Include only web CSS #}
{% tailwind_css "web" %}
```

The `build` command processes all entries, and the `watch` command monitors all source files simultaneously.

### Staging Environment

Balanced between dev flexibility and prod stability:

```python
# settings/staging.py
TAILWIND_CLI_VERSION = "4.1.3"  # Pin to stable version
TAILWIND_CLI_AUTOMATIC_DOWNLOAD = True  # Allow downloads
TAILWIND_CLI_DIST_CSS = "css/tailwind.min.css"  # Minified output
```

### Production Environment

Maximum performance and reliability:

```python
# settings/production.py
TAILWIND_CLI_VERSION = "4.1.3"  # Pin exact version
TAILWIND_CLI_AUTOMATIC_DOWNLOAD = False  # Disable downloads
TAILWIND_CLI_PATH = "/usr/local/bin/tailwindcss"  # Pre-installed CLI
TAILWIND_CLI_DIST_CSS = "css/tailwind.min.css"  # Optimized output
```
